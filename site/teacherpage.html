Kellerof Central Missouri State University to apply for a supplemental ResearchExperience for Teachers (RET) to his National Science Foundation (NSF)grant.&nbsp; NSF granted the request and Trish and her husband Stan (aformer biology teacher who is now the instructional technology coordinatorfor the Warrensburg school district) began documenting the research projectin Warrensburg as they interviewed and photographed the student climbersas they trained in the double rope tree climbing techniques and attendedintroductory seminars on entomology, ecology of the GSMNP, and field techniquesand tools. With the cooperation of Discover Life in America, Trish andStan joined Dr. Keller's team while the team was in the Great Smoky MountainsNational Park to study the biodiversity and ecology of tree canopy biota.After joining the team in the field, the days and evenings were filledwith learning about the taxa, exploring several locales of the GSMNP, actingas ground crew for the climbers, and documenting the procedures and experiencesof the team.</font><p><font face="Arial">The two-tiered website that you are now viewing willallow worldwide access to the experience of tree canopy research and allowsecondary students the opportunity to conduct parallel field research intheir locality.&nbsp; The website activities mirror the three phases ofDr. Keller's original project: Adventure, Lab, and Publication.&nbsp; Anyonewho visits the website will be able to experience a virtual version offield research and get a good understanding of what the All Taxa BiodiversityInventory (ATBI) is all about.&nbsp; Interested student groups can thenchoose to continue to the second tier of the web activities and conductsimilar field research in their region.&nbsp; Trish's Warrensburg MiddleSchool seventh graders will be studying the myxomycetes, lichens, and insectsof a Warrensburg location through field and lab work, followed by posterpresentations of their findings.</font><p><font face="Arial">It is hoped that the website experience will encouragemore secondary students, in Warrensburg and beyond, to choose some formof field biology as their future career.</font><p><font face="Arial"><b>TARGETED AGE RANGE:&nbsp; </b>Grades 7 - 12, althoughthe first tier should be of interest to adults, as well.</font><p><font face="Arial"><b>ESTIMATED TIME:&nbsp; </b>Tier One requires oneto two hours (7th graders on block scheduling required about 1.5 hourswhen using the <a href="CanopyTier1worksheet.htm" target="_blank">accompanyingworksheet </a>that guides the reader to some of the links and to the libraryof definitions.)&nbsp; Tier Two is designed to be a long-term project thatcould span a few weeks to a few months.&nbsp; This would be dependent onwhether the teacher chooses one taxa or more for the field and lab investigations,how many skills and concepts will be addressed, and what type of end productwill be produced for the "Publication" phase. Warrensburg students workedon this project for all, or part od, 36 class blocks during our first yearof piloting the project.</font><p><font face="Arial"><b>PRIMARY CONTENT FOCUS:&nbsp; </b>Field biology,scientific research and inquiry, classification, ecology, myxomycetes,insects, lichens</font><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</blockquote><center><b><font face="Arial"><font color="#003333"><font size=+2>SiteMap</font></font></font></b></center><center><table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=4 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="450" HEIGHT="218" ><tr><td WIDTH="25%" HEIGHT="40" BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC"><center><font face="Arial"><font color="#000033">&nbsp;Teacher Page</font></font><br><font face="Arial"><font color="#000033"><font size=-2><a href="index.html" target="_blank">(Youare here!)</a></font></font></font></center></td><td COLSPAN="2" HEIGHT="36" BGCOLOR="#999999"><center><a href="index.html" target="_blank">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">TitlePage (Tier One)</font></a></center></td><td WIDTH="25%" HEIGHT="36">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td></td><td COLSPAN="2" HEIGHT="40" BGCOLOR="#6699CC"><center><font face="Arial"><a href="openingstory.html" target="_blank">T</a><a href="openingstoryend.html" target="_blank">ierTwo, the iAdventure</a></font></center></td><td WIDTH="25%" HEIGHT="40">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td WIDTH="25%" HEIGHT="38"><center>&nbsp;<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><a href="library.html" target="_blank">Library</a></font></center></td><td WIDTH="25%" HEIGHT="38" BGCOLOR="#669999"><center><font face="Arial"><a href="story2a.html" target="_blank">StoryPage 2A</a></font></center></td><td WIDTH="25%" HEIGHT="38" BGCOLOR="#66CCCC"><center><font face="Arial"><a href="story2b.html" target="_blank">StoryPage 2B</a></font></center></td><td WIDTH="25%" HEIGHT="38">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td WIDTH="25%" HEIGHT="41">&nbsp;</td><td COLSPAN="2" HEIGHT="41" BGCOLOR="#FFCC99"><center><font face="Arial"><a href="conclusion.html">"</a><a href="conclusion.html" target="_blank">Createa Conclusion" Page</a></font></center></td><td WIDTH="25%" HEIGHT="41">&nbsp;</td></tr></table></center><blockquote>&nbsp;<center><p><b><font face="Arial"><font color="#003333"><font size=+2>BackgroundInformation</font></font></font></b></center><p><font face="Arial">An iAdventure is a way of teaching students importantconcepts and skills by involving them in a storyline about one or morecharacters (fictional or real).&nbsp;

Tier Two then guides participatingstudents, and their teachers, through their own field experience and follow-uplab work.&nbsp; These stages are more fully explained in the "ResourcesNeeded" section below, as each teacher will need to facilitate a researchproject that works for them.</font><p><font face="Arial"><a href="planningtips.html" target="_blank">PLANNINGTIPS</a>:&nbsp;
