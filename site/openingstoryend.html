ADVENTURE PHASE LEADS TO THE LAB PHASE</font></font></font></i></b></center>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#006666"><font size=+1>You should
now have a pretty good idea of what a field research experience can be
like.&nbsp; Of course it doesn't end there, as the scientists and undergraduate
researchers will try to answer questions that have never been answered
before.&nbsp; They do that by making observations of their own and looking
at what is already known about their topic of interest.&nbsp; They then
figure out what unsolved puzzles interest them and develop a question that
can be answered by carrying out a controlled study.&nbsp; Then they try
to fill in the gaps by finding out new information through the design of
controlled experiments.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#006666"><font size=+1>The GSMNP
team began the research project with some idea of the questions that they
would be trying to answer.&nbsp; Those questions are refined  as the bark specimens are cultured, lichens are identified, and the insects are sorted to order
and counted.&nbsp; Dr. Keller will work with student assistants to culture
the bark samples and record the myxomycetes present.&nbsp; Doctors Ely,
Tonsberg, and Lumbsch will work on identification of lichens, and Dr. Ely
will also organize the environmental data collected with the HOBOs.&nbsp;
Dr. Wilson will identify and sort insects, with a special focus on the
planthoppers.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#006666"><font size=+1>The GSMNP
research individuals will be deciding on questions to answer such as:</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#006666"><font size=+1>• “What
is the effect of species of tree on the number of myxomycete species cultured
from the bark?”</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#006666"><font size=+1>• “What
is the effect of tree species on the number and diversity of insect species
captured in a canopy trap?”</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#006666"><font size=+1>•&nbsp;
“What is the effect of bark pH on the diversity of lichens present?”</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#006666"><font size=+1>...And
every good researcher must share his, or her, findings.&nbsp; The scientists,
along with the students working with them, will write articles, present
at conferences, and share the data with others.&nbsp; <a href="http://dlia.org/atbi/twig/slime_mold_tree.shtml" target="_blank">Click

from a trip to the GSMNP in 2000.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://dlia.org/atbi/twig/slime_mold.shtml" TARGET="_BLANK">Click

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#006666"><font size=+1> You will now join your teacher and classmates to prepare for, and participate
in, a  research project of your own.&nbsp; Maybe your teacher has even selected
a local site for you to explore and collect specimens from.&nbsp; It may be right there on school grounds or maybe a local natural area. Maybe you will have the opportunity to help with research of a scientist like Dr. Keller. Either way, be sure
to enjoy this chance to be a part of scientific research! </font></font></font>
