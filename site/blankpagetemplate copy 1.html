He met the team “hopefuls” out at PertleSprings, a park-like area owned by CMSU, for a day of hands-on trainingwith the Big Shot and climbing gear.&nbsp; Charlie helped each studentget “saddled up” and to practice the art of climbing trees.&nbsp; He shareda lot of stories and tips throughout the day, but the one you rememberthe most is that even though “the saddles are getting lighter and lessbulky, you still have to have the conditioning, the strength, and the mindto figure out what you got to do when you are up there 200 feet.”&nbsp;You begin to realize that every tree will pose it’s own set of challengesand that you will have to be able to solve problems as you go.</font></font></font><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#003333"><font size=+1></font></font></font><p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#003333"><font size=+1>You alsomeet Dr. Steve Wilson at the climbing school session.&nbsp; Dr. Wilsonis an entomologist at CMSU and is a world expert on planthoppers.&nbsp;He is part of the research team and will oversee the collection and identificationof insects.</font></font></font><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#003333"><font size=+1></font></font></font><p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#003333"><font size=+1>You werereally excited when you got the call from Dr. Keller inviting you to jointhe team…and then you got nervous.&nbsp; What would it be like to livewith ten or so strangers for three week stretches…two different times…ina “field station”???&nbsp; Did you have the strength to climb high intothe canopy each day?&nbsp; Did you know enough to be able to recognizeand collect specimens, or would you miss something that might be important?&nbsp;…had you gotten yourself in too deep? …but, wow! …it still sounded likesuch a great adventure…you would just have to learn as you went!&nbsp;With a bit of jitters, you decided to “go for it!”</font></font></font><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#003333"><font size=+1></font></font></font><p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#003333"><font size=+1>++++++++++++++++++</font></font></font><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#003333"><font size=+1></font></font></font><p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#003333"><font size=+1>You arestill a bit nervous about this adventure when you show up for the day-longpre-trip meeting.&nbsp; You don’t really know any of the other studentsand you feel like you have a lot to learn. Drs. Keller, Wilson, and Elyare all there to give you and the other students an overview of what youwill be doing and to go over last minute details and packing reminders.&nbsp;You&nbsp; are pretty amazed when you learn that all three faculty membersare going AND they are doing it on their own time.&nbsp; It’s pretty coolthat they don’t mind spending so much time with a bunch of undergraduates.Everyone seems pretty nice and you start getting more excited and lessnervous.&nbsp; But you decide that you better take plenty of batteriesfor your discman…the trip in the van from Warrensburg, Missouri to theCade’s Cove field station in Tennessee will take…get this…at least THIRTEENhours!</font></font></font><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#003333"><font size=+1></font></font></font><p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#003333"><font size=+1>Dr. Wilsongives you and the other students a presentation and handout of the representativemembers of the most common orders of insects and more specific informationon the planthoppers that his studies focus on. He poses some questionsthat will be explored with the insects collected during the trip:&nbsp;Will numbers of planthoppers be greater in the canopy or on the ground?&nbsp;Are the derbid planthoppers as rare in the canopy as they are on the ground?&nbsp;The team also gets a chance to put together a Sante canopy insect trapand learn how it works.</font></font></font><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#003333"><font size=+1></font></font></font><p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#003333"><font size=+1>Dr. Elythen gives an overview of the objectives of the research, some backgroundon the different environmental factors that will be measured, and an introductionto the bryophytes and lichens that will be collected.&nbsp; Dr Ely’s studyof the data will focus on quantitative data and some of the collectingmethods were discussed so you are beginning to get a visual picture ofwhat tasks you will need to do while up in the tree.</font></font></font><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#003333"><font size=+1></font></font></font><p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#003333"><font size=+1>Dr. Kellerwraps up the day with lists of “to dos” and “to brings” and enthusiasmas he tells us that we will be “going up into trees that no one else hasever gone up in!”&nbsp; His excitement is infectious!</font></font></font><br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#003333"><font size=+1></font></font></font>&nbsp;<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#003333"><font size=+1></font></font></font>&nbsp;<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#003333"><font size=+1></font></font></font>&nbsp;<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#003333"><font size=+1></font></font></font>&nbsp;<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#003333"><font size=+1></font></font></font>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<blockquote>&nbsp;</blockquote><center><table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="420" HEIGHT="66" ><tr><td WIDTH="38%"><center><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size=+1><a href="story2a.html">ChoiceA</a></font></font></b><br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size=-1>(or other name)</font></font></center></td><td WIDTH="24%"><center><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size=+1><a href="index.html">GoBack</a></font></font></b></center></td><td WIDTH="38%"><center><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size=+1><a href="story2b.html">ChoiceB</a></font></font></b><br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size=-1>(or other name)</font></font></center></td></tr></table></center></body></html>
